# SDLauncher
Emulator Launcher to play games using the Sinden Lightgun

## Use case
- As a player I want to be able to launch all my lighgun games from a single source (Frontend (Launchbox, etc) or Commandline) without having to manually change specific settings for each game
- I also want to be able to configure this without any coding knowledge.
- All the files have to be contained in one folder
- I have to be able to launch other programs (nomousy, demulshooter) before/after running my emu
- I want to keep my roms in a folder of my choosing
